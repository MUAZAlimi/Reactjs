          React Router is a popular library for handling navigation and routing in React.js applications. It enables developers to create single-page applications (SPAs) with navigation behavior similar to traditional multi-page applications. React Router provides a way to synchronize your UI with the current URL, allowing users to navigate between different parts of your application without a full page reload.
